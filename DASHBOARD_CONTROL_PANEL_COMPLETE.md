## 🎯 Production Deployment

To deploy to production:

1. **Configure Environment:**
   ```powershell
   python configure_production.py
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```powershell
   $env:BYBIT_PRODUCTION_CONFIRMED = "true"
   $env:BYBIT_PRODUCTION_ENABLED = "true"
   $env:BYBIT_API_KEY = "your_production_api_key"
   $env:BYBIT_API_SECRET = "your_production_api_secret"
   ```

3. **Validate System:**
   - Use System Validation panel in dashboard
   - All components must show "active" status
   - Production readiness must be "true"

4. **Switch to Production:**
   - Use Environment Control panel
   - Click "Switch to Production"
   - Confirm all safety checks
